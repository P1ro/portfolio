Job description is on jdesc.png. i add almost every option for logging, adjusting accoding to the exact requeriment  shouldnt be hard.
Also i think best option for this since is already on a vm is using a docker mysql image.

Local IP could be grab from router/modem website will be more accurate external ip to compare with otehrs websites.

Have a nice day
